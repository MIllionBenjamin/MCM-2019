A team work. Finish the paper Research on the opioid abuse crisis in the United States —Based on visual data processing generalized linear model. 

After analyzing a large volume of data, we summarized the spread and characteristics of the reported synthetic opioid and heroin incidents (cases) from 2010 to 2016 in and between the five states and their counties. We also made reasonable predictions of how the opioid abuse in and between the five states will develop. Besides, we design a scheme to avoid the deterioration of this situation.
